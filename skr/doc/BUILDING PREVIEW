Preview should be created based on production.

1) Take a backup of production (or use a recent daily or weekley backup).

2) rebuild the preview slice using that backup.
    Go to the slice in the slicehost admin console.
    Select rebuild
    Pick the image.
    Wait for the backup to complete.

3) update the preview server so it works right
     - ssh into preview
        - You may have to remove the signature for the host by running the following.
            rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
     - update config
        - the config file is here /opt/nginx/conf/conf.d/virtual.conf
              /usr/local/nginx/conf/conf.d/virtual.conf
        - replace knackregistry.com with preview.knackregistry.com everywhere you see it.
        - set rails_env to preview.
        - save the file
     - restart the server
        shutdown -r now
