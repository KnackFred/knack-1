INSTALLING V1.1

FIRST CLEAN UP NGINX.
Update NGINX If necessary:
take a look at /opt/nginx/conf/conf.d/virtual.conf
Make sure all of the path are right.
check the environment
Restart nginx:
/usr/bin/nginx -s stop
/usr/bin/nginx

MAKE SURE EVERYTHING STILL WORKS double check the fonts.



NOW FOR THE ACTUAL UPGRADE

UPDATE RUBY INFRASTRUCTURE
on server:
gem update --system
gem update bundler

NOTES:  You may need to use bundle:exec cap instead of cap.
A lot of this came from this article on capistrano.  https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-From-The-Beginning


GET CAPISTRANO UP AND RUNNING
Check the config file ./config/deploy.rb make sure the information looks right.

run cap deploy:setup
You'll need to provide the password for the preview server.
Make sure this passes without errors.

run cap deploy:check
You'll need to provide the password for the preview server.
Make sure this passes without errors.  If there are errors log onto the server and fix the issues.

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
On the server run the following.
yum install libxslt-devel libxml2-devel

Install Sphinx:
rpm -Uvh http://sphinxsearch.com/files/sphinx-2.0.1-1.el5.i386.rpm

DEPLOY THE CODE

- Deal with the cert Issues
  SSH into the host.
  run
     svn info https://svn.blackshadow.name:1443/svn/knackregistry

  Then select p to permanently accept the cert from the svn host.
  You do not have to actually authenticate.

- Deploy
cap deploy:update

NOTES:
Be patient this may take a while.
This gets the latest code from SVN, not from your local machine.


MIGRATE THE DB
Set the environment for where you are
export RAILS_ENV="preview"
or
export RAILS_ENV="production"
NOTE: You can skip this if the variable has already been set on log in.  look at /etc/profile.d/rails-env.sh

migrate the database by running the following.
   In Preview
     bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="preview"
   In Production
     bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

Make sure everything ran properly.  Check the output carefully.

UPDATE THE WEB SERVER CONFIGURATION:
open /opt/nginx/conf/conf.d/virtual.conf
name should point to current.
Log files should go in shared.
Also, If this is preview set the rails_env to "preview" in the config file.

Restart nginx:
/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx -s stop
/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx

START UP SPHINX:

config
  rake ts:config
create the index;
  rake ts:index
Start Sphinx
  rake ts:start

SET UP THE SPHINX RE-INDEX SCHEDULED TASK
create a new file sphinx in /etc/cron.hourly

Put the following 3 lines in it.
#!/bin/sh
cd /home/ilya/public_html/current
bundle exec /usr/local/bin/rake thinking_sphinx:index RAILS_ENV=preview

Set the file permissions so the file is executable
chmod a+x sphinx.sh

Now the index will be rebuilt every hour.
run it manually to make sure it work.
./sphinx.sh

RESTART THE APP
  touch /home/ilya/public_html/current/tmp/restart.txt

--------------------------
First things to test:
Search
Log-in
FB Integration
Add from other site
characters (Hansel stuff)

--------------------------

WHEN REDEPLOYING ALWAYS RESTART THINKING SPHINX.
rake ts:restart

In Preview update the callback url for the bookmark tool.
